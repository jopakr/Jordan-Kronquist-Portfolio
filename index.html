      <h1>About Me!</h1>
      <p>A jack of all trades and master of none. I don't think I would ever like to master a certain skill-set. 
        I really enjoy and thrive off of learning and expanding my horizons. Not one for any sort of stagnation or standing still.
        Decided to switch up my career as a well establish and traveled Art Director and Production Designer for tv, film, commercials, music videos,
        and try my hand at coding. Which I have to say was one of the hardest, and continues to be a challenging endeavors I have ever
        expreinced. SO fun though!
      </p>
      <p>I hail from all over the beautfil Pacific Northwest, some time in Washington, born in Seattle, roamed the Inland Empire some. 
        Raised for some years, the formative ones, in Spokane attending my pre-colllegiate education in so much as a laxidasical way of 
        escaping the conservative and stifling atmosphere that area broods and harbors. Some great memories inspite of it all. 
      </p>
      <p>My summers and winters growing up, the truly scerene moments of my life, were spent roaming my Father's home in the Rocky
        Mountains of Montana. He grew up on a ranch so by proxy so did I in those special short spans of time between academics. 
        Spending time with my Mom, Dad, and younger brother Ryan, was everything. Good people. 
      </p>
      <p>All that said; I hope to bring light and brevity to each and every day that I can here at Epicodus. Looking forward to 
        creating and fostering some strong relationships here.
