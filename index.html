        <p>A jack of <em>all trades<em> and master of <em>none</em>. I don't think I would ever like to master a certain skill-set. 
        I really enjoy and thrive off of <strong>learning</strong> and <strong>expanding</strong> my horizons. Not one for any sort of stagnation or standing still.
        Decided to switch up my career as a well establish and traveled Art Director and Production Designer for tv, film, commercials, music videos,
        and try my hand at coding. Which I have to say was one of the hardest, and continues to be a challenging endeavors I have ever
        expreinced. SO fun though!

        <p>I hail from all over the <strong>beautiful</strong> Pacific Northwest, some time in Washington, born in Seattle, roamed the Inland Empire some. 
        Raised for some years, the formative ones, in Spokane attending my pre-colllegiate education in so much as a laxidasical way of 
        escaping the conservative and stifling atmosphere that area broods and harbors. Some great memories <em>inspite</em>of it all. 
        </p>
        <p>My summers and winters growing up, the truly scerene moments of my life, were spent roaming my Father's home in the Rocky
        Mountains of Montana. He grew up on a ranch so by proxy so did I in those special short spans of time between academics. 
        Spending time with my Mom, Dad, and younger brother Ryan, was everything. Good people. 
        </p>
        <p>All that said; I hope to bring light and brevity to each and every day that I can here at 
        <a href="https://www.epicodus.com">Epicodus</a>. Looking forward to 
        creating and fostering some strong relationships here.
